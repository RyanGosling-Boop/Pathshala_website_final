      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2500">
        It is indeed an immense pleasure for me to lead a with huge aspiring
        group of learners with age range of 6 to 18 years old along with the
        team of teachers and staff. The dream of our founding team of making a
        progressive interactive school where everyone feels proud while
        achieving academic goals has come true.<br /><br />Pathshala has
        always been putting emphasis on challenging and balanced education,
        which prepares its pupils for adult responsibilities in the new
        generation celebrating their unique abilities. The school is committed
        to society at large and aims to fulfill its obligations to the
        communities it touches, with appropriate initiatives, in a dedicated
        and comprehensive manner. Education should open one’s mind to a
        constant process of learning. We have made effort students along with
        the staff in this regard to the needs to be humble, accessible to all
        and inviting participation in expressing with purpose in various ways
        of expression.<br /><br />Pathshala is full of awesome students and
        teachers who arrive each day Ready, Willing and Engaging in Learning
        Activities. School itself is a mini-universe for a student. These are
        culture, ethics, service, positivity and responsibility. I believe
        students have the demonstrated these values in creativity too. A
        student’s world is a colourful made up of multitude of hopes and
        aspirations. They have dreams and we have a duty to guide their dreams
        become a reality. <br /><br />
        In the changing context, a school is not only a place to pursue the
        academic excellence but also to motivate and empower the students to
        be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and productive members of an
        ever-changing global society. Converting every individual into a
        self-reliant and independent citizen in the world today is changing at
        such an accelerated rate. We, educators, have paused and reflected on
        this entire system of education in addition to state-of -the-art labs
        and infrastructure. A committed and supportive management, dedicated
        teachers, caring and participative parents blend harmoniously to
        create this school as a good school. <br /><br />
        The graph of success of our alumni in their tertiary education, the
        trust from parents and guardians along with cooperation from local
        community is always motivating factors for the school to keep our 19
        years continuous pace ahead. <br /><br />Ishwor Adhikari <br /><br />
